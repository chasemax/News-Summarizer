## Introduction

## Project

For our project, we are creating a linux tool that gather security articles from around the interent using RSS Feeds and web scraping, it will then compile all the articles in a nice repository for easy viewing from security professionals.

Initially we are planning on it being commandline based for ease of initial development, but will introduce a GUI/web app later on.
